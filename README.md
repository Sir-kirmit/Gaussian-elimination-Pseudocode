# Gaussian-elimination-Pseudocode
Gaussian elimination transforms a given m Ã— n matrix A into a matrix in row-echelon form.  In the following pseudocode, A[i, j] denotes the entry of the matrix A in row i and column j with the indices starting from 1. The transformation is performed in place, meaning that the original matrix is lost for being eventually replaced by its row-echelon form.
